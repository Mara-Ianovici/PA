# Lab3
## Compulsory
- created 2 interfaces Identifiable and Storage
- sorted the nodes by their name

## Homework:
- added a HashMap that stores the adjancences 
- added a default method in the interface Storage to return the size in other storage units like B and MB
- implementing _Dijkstra to find the shortest paths between the Identifiable nodes

## Bonus:
- modified Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the path according to the probability, not the distance
